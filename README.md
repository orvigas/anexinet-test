	1. Write a function that adds two numbers without using any arithmetic operators.
		final double a = 3.000000;
		final double b = 7.000000;
			OP: a + b = 10.000000


	2. Given 2 strings of unknown characters (but it cannot be repeated) create a function that returns an array of the characters
	   that are repeated in both strings in the most efficient way.
		final String s1 = "Flying bat!!";
		final String s2 = "Why batman?";
			OP: s1 intersect s2 = [a, b, t, y, n]


	3. Write a function that takes a string containing a number in base X along with an integer of the base X. The function must
	   return the integer value of that string/base pair.
		final String number = "55A";
		final int base = 16;
			OP: number in base = 1370 decimal


	4. Write a function such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0 , its entire row and column are set to 0 and then printed out.
	   Origin matrix:
		[
		  [1, 2, 3 ],
		  [4, 0, 6 ],
		  [7, 8, 9 ]
		]
	   Result matrix:
		[
		  [1, 0, 3 ],
		  [0, 0, 0 ],
		  [7, 0, 9 ]
		]


	5. Write a function that convert the given number into a Roman Numeral - The function needs to receive a Number and Return a String (The Number can be between 1 and 3999).
	   final int decimalNumber = 3999;
			OP: decimalNumber = MMMCMXCIX


	6. Write a function to print all permutations of a string. Max string length can be 50 characters.
	   final Sting permutateString = AB;
			OP: permutateString:
			AB
			BA
